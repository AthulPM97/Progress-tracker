Don't rely on external stuff like music for motivation.
You must be able to create that fire on your own.
Everyday that you have spent not pushing yourself further from your limit is a day wasted.

You must squeeze your soul and push yourself till your mind cracks and then pick it apart.
And find why your mind is doing what it is doing. The world is the training ground.
Put yourself in those situations and dig deep into youself. Follow the trail of whys.
