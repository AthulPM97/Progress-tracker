I have tightness around the back of my head. I have noticed that it seems to be caused by raised shoulders.
I think it is caused by the conditioning at home by my father being so terrorizing. 
I have to stretch and release it.

I need to gain full range of motion in my body.

Stretching and holding the stretch where I feel the tightness feels very good.
I feel free in the mind after that as well.
