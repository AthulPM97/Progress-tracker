Face fear's bluff

Endless opportunities that we could've taken.
Endless excuses for why we didn't.
When we gonna stop disappointing ourselves my friend.

Being angry is too much unnecessary work and waste of brain power.
Putting on a front is also a big waste of energy and awareness.
The best times I've ever had was when I wasn't hyper self aware and self conscious.

Observe Don't Absorb. 
You must be radiating energy and creating instead of consuming endlessly.
