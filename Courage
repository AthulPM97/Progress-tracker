Face fear's bluff

Endless opportunities that we could've taken.
Endless excuses for why we didn't.
When we gonna stop disappointing ourselves my friend.

Being angry is too much unnecessary work and waste of brain power.

Observe Don't Absorb. 
You must be radiating energy and creating instead of consuming endlessly.
